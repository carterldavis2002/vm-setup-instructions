# Virtual Machine First-time Setup Instructions

This project was created for my Fall 2022 Technical Writing (ENGL 308) at Northern Illinois University. These instructions explain how to setup a virtual machine through VirtualBox. No prior knowledge is required except how to operate a computer at a basic level.
